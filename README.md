# DSA-Preparation

Hey,I am Spandana HN,3rd year computer science student.
I am starting my dsa preparation journey for internships and placements.I have started preparing from early months of this year but i was not consistent in this journey,but now for this next 6 months preparation period I am documenting & updating my coding journey here.

I am following Codehelp(love Babber bhai's )dsa course and Striver A2Z DSA sheet to keep track of DSA learning.

This repository consists of topic wise folders with Easy,Medium & Hard Questions codes
